	</p></center><font size="6"face="chiller"color="black"> Thruthfully, I did not have so much life experience.</font></p>. 
	<p>But I have experience that I remember until now. When I was six years old, I had drown at river and nearly did.. Since then, I was like I'm trauma of water. But several years after that, I overcome my trauma and till now I really like water.</p> 
	<p>I am also had several accidents involving car and motorcycle. When  I was seven years old, my family and I were involve in car accident but thankfully we just had several minor injuries.</p> 
	<p>As for motorcycle, I had accident for four times with it. But thank god, every time I'm accident, I am not badly injured and still breathing till now. </p> 
	<p>That's all about my experiences. It's all about my bad experiences</p>
